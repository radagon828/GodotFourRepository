# 2D Platformer

This demo is a pixel art 2D platformer with single-player
and two player splitscreen multiplayer.

It demonstrates how to code characters and physics-based objects
in a real game context. This is a relatively complete demo
where the player can jump, walk on slopes, fire bullets,
interact with enemies, and collect items. It contains one
level. The player is invincible, unlike the enemies.

Language: GDScript

Renderer: Forward Plus
